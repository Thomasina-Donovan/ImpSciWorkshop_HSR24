# About

## WORKSHOP 2: Introduction to Implementation Science

### Workshop description

The Health Services Research Association of Australia and New Zealand (HSRAANZ) is pleased to announce a half-day workshop on Implementation Science Skills in Practice, to be delivered by members of the Queensland University of Technology’s Australian Centre for Health Services Innovation (AusHSI).

This introductory workshop is suitable for researchers, clinicians and policymakers who want to understand the role implementation science can play in improving the design, delivery and evaluation of health services and interventions.

This workshop will cover topics such as:

Implementation Science 101: an introduction for beginners; Theories, models and frameworks for implementation; Implementation strategies; Implementation outcomes; Understanding implementation context, including identifying barriers and enablers; and How to practically apply implementation science methodologies in the real-world. The content will be delivered by a team of experts from AusHSI including Associate Professor Zephanie Tyack, Dr Bridget Abell, Dr Sundresan Naicker, Dr Michelle Allen and Ms Thomasina Donovan.

The first part of the workshop will include presentations which will give attendees a good introduction to key ideas in the field and provide examples of how implementation science and implementation frameworks have been used in the design and implementation of real-world problems and projects. The second session will be a hands-on activity where participants will be given qualitative data and interview excerpts from real implementation studies and be guided through the process of mapping this data to a selected implementation framework (CFIR or NASSS) to identify study barriers and enablers and discuss potential implementation strategies. Finally, the day will conclude with a panel Q & A session where attendees can ask the presenters their burning implementation questions or follow-up any topics from throughout the afternoon.
